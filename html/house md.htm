            Through this donation, Vogler becomes the new chairman of the board and orders House to fire one of his team members.
            Vogler does this to show House he can control him: "I need to know that whatever I ask you to do,however distasteful you find it, you'll do it"</pre></li>

              The third season of House (also called House, M.D.) ran on FOX from September 5, 2006 to May 29, 2007.
              Early in the season, House temporarily regains the use of his leg due to ketamine treatment after he was shot in the season two finale.
              Later in the season, he leaves a stubborn patient in an exam room with a thermometer in his rectum.
              Because House is unwilling to apologize, the patient, who turns out to be a police detective,
              starts an investigation around House's Vicodin addiction.

            The fourth season of House, also known as House, M.D., premiered on September 25, 2007 and ended May 19, 2008.
            Having previously fired Chase, and with Foreman and Cameron quitting, House starts a competition between 40 applicants for the vacant positions.
            He eventually narrows them down to seven, firing one each episode.
            In the episode "Games", he fires Amber "Cutthroat Bitch" Volakis (Anne Dudek), 
            hiring Dr. Chris Taub (Peter Jacobson), Dr. Lawrence Kutner (Kal Penn) and Dr. Remy "Thirteen" Hadley (Olivia Wilde) as his new team. 
            Dr. Foreman rejoins the team after his dismissal from another hospital.
            Meanwhile, Amber begins a relationship with Wilson.

             The seventh season of House premiered on September 20, 2010, and ended on May 23, 2011.
             House and Cuddy attempt to make a real relationship work 
             and face the question as to whether their new relationship will affect their ability to diagnose patients.
             The new season features a new opening title sequence. This was the second change in the opening sequence since the show began;
             Jennifer Morrison's name was removed from the credits,
             while Peter Jacobson's and Olivia Wilde's were added to it, with new background images also inserted into the traditional title sequence.
             This is the last season to feature Lisa Edelstein, who did not return for the eighth season.</pre></li>

             Olivia Wilde (Dr. Remy "Thirteen" Hadley) also left the show after the third episode in order to further her film career,
             although she returned at the end of the series. On January 8, 2012,
             Kevin Reilly (Fox President of Entertainment) stated that Fox had been "avoiding" a decision on the fate of the series,
             as it was "hard to imagine the network without House" and that the decision on the future of the series would be a "close call".
             Hugh Laurie's contract on House expired once the eighth season was over, and Laurie confirmed that once House was over,
